# I am aiming to develop a machine learning model to predict the next day's behavior of todays top-5 performing stocks in the Indian stock market. 

## What I have Done

#### 22-12-23
1) I have extract the historical data of the Shares
2) I have loaded to the local Postgres DB
3) Check the Next Day behavior of the Top-5 Performing stocks.
4) The Graph came out really well but was not able to figure out the actual trend , It was neigther negative all time or positive , all the times, so i thought as depends on the other market factors, we should extract all the required metrics and then use ML to predict


## Further Steps

1) Extract all the required metrics
2) Pick the sutable ML algorithms
3) Train and Models and test it
4) Add Sentitment analysis data 
5) Also download minute level data for shares 
6) Then train the model and test it



 Response from chat gpt

Question is - i want to run some ml algorithm to predict this , the features i am thinking to extract for the top 5 gainers of each day is 

growth percentage of that day
growth percentage of the next day
p/e ratio of that day
p/e ratio of the next day
average p/e ratio of stock 

suggest me some more variables for better accurate result and also suggest me the best fitting ml algorithm for this usecase


Response is - 

Building a machine learning (ML) model to predict stock market behavior is a challenging task due to the complexity and volatility of financial markets. It's important to note that predicting stock prices is inherently uncertain, and no model can guarantee accurate predictions. However, creating a model based on historical data can provide insights.

Here are some additional features you might consider incorporating into your model:

Volume Indicators:

Trading volume on the day.
Average trading volume.
Volume changes over time.
Technical Indicators:

Moving averages (short-term and long-term).
Relative Strength Index (RSI).
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
Market Sentiment:

News sentiment analysis related to the stock.
Social media sentiment.
Market Indices:

Performance of relevant market indices (e.g., S&P 500).
Volatility indices (e.g., VIX).
Company-specific Fundamentals:

Earnings reports and surprises.
Dividend yield.
Debt-to-equity ratio.
Market Conditions:

Interest rates.
Economic indicators (e.g., GDP growth).
As for ML algorithms, the choice depends on various factors, including the size of your dataset, the complexity of the relationships, and computational resources. Here are some commonly used algorithms for financial forecasting:

Linear Regression:

Simple and interpretable but assumes a linear relationship.
Decision Trees and Random Forests:

Can capture non-linear relationships and handle feature importance.
Support Vector Machines (SVM):

Useful for classification tasks, and can be applied to regression.
Neural Networks:

Deep learning models can capture complex patterns, but they require more data and computational resources.
Gradient Boosting Models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM):

Powerful ensemble methods that often perform well in regression tasks.
Time Series Models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA):

Specifically designed for time-series data but may not capture complex patterns as well as machine learning models.
It's important to split your dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. Additionally, consider using cross-validation to assess generalization. Model performance metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared) will help you evaluate how well your model is performing.

Remember that the stock market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and predicting short-term price movements is inherently challenging. Always be cautious in interpreting the results and consider seeking advice from financial experts when making investment decisions.
